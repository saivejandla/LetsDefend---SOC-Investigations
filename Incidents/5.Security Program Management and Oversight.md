### **5.1 Elements of effective Security Governance**

- ### Guidelines
- policies : Policies are a statement of organizational intent
	- **Information security policies**
		- compliance requirements
		- details security procedures
		- roles and responsibilities
		- orgs must enforce the policies
	- **AUP Acceptable usable policy**
		- what is acceptable use of the org assets, detailed documentation, rules of behaviors
		- internet use, telephones, mobiles, computers, printers
		- these are used by the org to limit liability
	- **Business Continuity:**
		- nothing goes according to the plan - disasters can cause disruptions t o the norm
		- we replay a lot of computers and tech is very prevasive
		- there  needs to be alternative to this
		- and these alternatives must be documented and these must be tested before problems occur
	- **Disaster Recovery:**
		- if disaster happens the IT should be ready
		- disasters are many and can be varied
			- natural disasters
			- tech or system failures
			- Human created disaters
		- a comprehensive plan
			- recovery locations
			- data recovery plan/ method
			- application restorations
			- IT team and employee availability
	- **Security Incidents:**
		- phishing emails
		- DDoS attack
		- data breach, confidential info
	-  **Incident response Roles**
		-  incident response team
		- it security managent 
		- compliance managers
		- technical staff
		- user community
		- Nist SP800 61 r2
			- incident response lifecycle
			- preparation
			- detection and analysis
			- containment, eradication, and recovery
			- post incident activity
		- playbook for his incident response process
			- A detailed process for incident response
	- **SDLC**
		- many ways to get from idea to app
		- agile(circular) vs waterfall(linear)
	-** **change management:**
		- how to make a change, upgrade software, firewall config, and many other switch ports
		- one of the most common risks, oftem overlooked
		- have clear policies

#### Standards:
Standards are defined to help organization achieve that intent through the use of rules
a formal def for using security technologies, complete documentations
ISO, NIST and some are written in house
- **Passwords:**
	- good password- complexity of a password good,
	- auth methods used in the org apps ldap, or ADF
	- passwords reset must be secure
	- passwords must be stored securely
- **Access Control:**
	- what type can some one can access
	- and what circumstances
	- determine how a user gets access
	- and doc how a users looses access( security issues, expirations, left org, renewels)
- **Physical Security:**
	- rules and policies for physical security
	- granting physical access
	- define the specific physical security req.
	- aditional security concerns
- **Encryption:**
	- encryption standards
	- implementations of the encryptiosn
	- passwords storage
	- data encryption- data in use, transit, rest will have diff set of standards

#### Procedures:
- **Change Management:**
	- formal process for managing a change avoid downtime, confusion, and mistakes
	- nothing changes without process
		- determine the scope of the change
		- analyze the risk associated with the change
		- create a plan
		- get end user approval
		- present the proposal to change for the controls board
		- have  a backup plan, if the change didn't workout
		- document tha changes
- onboarding:
	- it agreements needed to be signed
	- provide the req devices and accessess
	- offboarding
	- data on the hdd of the employee
- playbooks:
	- steps to follow during an incident
	- integrate them in to SOAR platform
	- step by step checklist

Monitoring and revision:

Governance structures:
	Boards:
		a panel of specialists
		sets the tasks or requirements for the committees
	Committees
		SME's
		considers i/p from board
		determines the next steps for the topic at hand
		presents the results to the board

#### External considerations:
- Regulatory:
	- regulations are oftern mandated
	- SOX - the public complany accounting act,
	- HIPAA- healthcare
- Legal
	- reporting legal activities
	- security breach notifications
	- legal requiremants may chnage based on the jurisdictions
	- cloud computing can be challenging
- industry
	- industry specific considerations
	- medical
	- electrical power
- geographical secuirty
	- local or regional
	- national
	- global

#### Data Roles and Responsibilities
- High level data relationships
	- data owner
		- accountable to the specific data 
		- VP of sales owns the relationship data
		- treasure own the financila information
	- data controller
		- manages the purposes and means bywhich personal data in processed
		- determine what data is used and how it is processed
	- data processor
		- process the dat on behalf of the data controller
	payroll department is the data controller and the payroll company id the data processor
	- data custodian:
		- gives the sensitivity lables to the data
		- ensures compliance with any applicable laws and standards
		- manages access rights to the data
		- ==implements  security controls to the data==
	- Data stewards
		- responsible for the data in their charge. That means they carry out data usage and security policies and ensure that data is handled appropriately.
	- Multiple roles oversee data throughout its life cycle, not just a data steward.
### **5.2 Elements of the Risk Management Process**
#### **Risk Management:**
- **Risk Identification:**
	- risk management helps to understand the potential risks
	- identify the weakness before they become the issue
	- growth brings risk
	- manage potential risks
	- qualify for internal and external threats
	- risk analysis helps to plan contingencies
- **Risk Assessment:**
	- performing risk assessment
		- one time assessment( accquisitions, new equipment installations, unique security threats)
		- continuous assessments( may be   part of an existing process, or a change control requires a risk assessment)
	- Ad hoc:
		- perform risk assessment when the situation arises
		- or when there is a new type of attack
	- recurring accessments:
		- eval on standard intervals
		- internal assessment every 3 months
		- mandata risk management PCIDSS
- **Risk Analysis:**
	- Qualitative:
		- identify significant risks
		- ![[Pasted image 20240821161202.png]]
	- Quantitative:
		- ARO annualized rate of Occurrence- how likely the incident will occur
		- Asset value (AV)- value of the asset to the organization
			- includes the value of the asset to the company, effect on the company sales, potential regulatory fines etc.
		- Exposure Factor(EF):  % of value lost due to an incident
	- SLE single loss expectancy 
		- SLE=AV * EF
		- laptop stolen= 1000(AV) *  1.0 (EF) = 1000(SLE)
	- ALE annualized loss expectancy
		- = ARO( annualized rate of Occurrence) * SLE(single loss expectancy)
		- = seven laptops per year(ARO) * 1000(SLE)= 7000(ALE)
	- impact can me more than monetary
	- Impact:
		- imact on life
		- impact on property
		- financial impact
	- Risk Liklihood
		- qualititative measurement of the risk
		- rare, possible, almost certain
	- risk probability
		- quantitative measurement of the risk
		- can be based on the historical performance
- **Risk Appetite**
	- The types and amount of risk, on a broad level, an organization is willing to accept in its pursuit of value.
	- is **the amount of risk, at a broad level, that an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its strategic objectives**.
	- Organizations that focus on reducing risk and that have significant compliance requirements are likely to adopt a conservative risk appetite. 
	- Expansionary risk appetite is rare when compliance and risk reduction are primary goals of the organization.
	- Authoritarian and legislative are not typically used terms to describe risk appetite
- **Risk tolerance**
	- Risk tolerance is the acceptable deviation from the organization's risk appetite.
	- the level of risk an entity is willing to assume in order to achieve a potential desired result.
- Risk Register:
	- identify and document the risks associated with each step
	- apply possible solutions to identified risks
	- monitor the results
	- **key risk indicators**- identify the risk indicators that could impact the org
	- **Risk owners**- assigned to someone to manage
	- **Risk Threshold**- cost of mitigation is equal to the value gained by the mitigation
#### **Risk management Strategies**
- Transfer:
	- move the risk to another party
	- buy some cybersecurity insurance
- Accept:
	- accepting the risk
- Accept with exemption:
	- a security reg or policy cannot be followed
	- exemption needs approval
- Accept with Exception:
	-  security policies are not applied
- Avoid:
	- completely avoid the risk
	- effectively removes the risk
- Mitigate
	- decrease the risk level
	- invest in security system
- Risk Reporting:
	- formal document of all the risks and how to handle them
	- contains critical and emerging risks

#### **Business Impact analysis:**
- Recovery:
	- Recovery time Objective:
		- how long is it to get up and running quickly
		- get back to a particular service level
	- recovery point objective:
		- how much data loss is acceptable
		- the system is online and how far does the data go back
	- Mean time to Repair:
		- avg time req to fix an issue
		- this includes the time spent on diagnosing the problem
		- it is imp to determine the cost and time associated with outages
	- Mean time between reviews:
		- the time between outages'
		- can be used to predict the failures 
		- total uptime and no of break downs
		- statistically plan for possible outages


### **5.3 Processes associated with third-party Risk Assessment and Management**

#### **Vendor Assessment**
- imp data is shared with vendors like payroll, travel, marketing, 
- perform a risk assessment
- use contracts for clear understanding
- **Penetration testing:**
	- simulate a attack
	- similar to vuln scanning
	- often a compliance mandate
	- done by a 3r party
	-  Rules of engagement\
		- a imp doc
		- type of testing and schedule
		- the rules
			- ip addresses
			- emergency contact
			- how to handle sensitive info
			- in scope and out of scope
- **right to audit clauses:**
	- its common to work with vendors for data sharing and outsourcing
	- right to audit should be mentioned in the contract anytime , and everyone should agree on that
	- ability to verify security before a breach occurs
- **evidence of internal audit:**
	- eval effective security controls
	- check for security control and process like access management, off boarding, password security, VPN control
- supply chain analysis:
	- system involved in creating a product
	- understand how a product reaches customer from supplier 
	- eval coordination between groups
	- identify areas of improvement
	- Access IT system supporting the operations
	- document the business process change
- independent assessments:
	- get a 3rd party to get this done

#### Vendor Selection Process:
- Due Diligence: 
- Conflict of interest
- vendor monitoring:
	- ongoing management of the vendor relationship
	- review occurs on regular basis
	- diff indicators can be checked for different indicators
- questionnaires
	- security related questions
#### **Types of Agreements**
- SLA Service level Agreement:
	- min terms of service provided
	- up time , response time agreement
	- commonly used between customers and service providers
	- Ex: contract with internet provider
- Memorandum of Understanding(MOU):
	- both sides agree to the general contents of the memorandum
	- usually states common goals but nothing more than that
	- may include statement of confidentiality
	- informal letter of intent, not a signed contract
- Memorandum of Agreement(MOA):
	- The next step above a MOU
	- both sides agree conditionally to the objectives
	- can also be legal document even without legal language
	-  unlike a contract cannot contain legally enforceable promises
- Master Service Agreement(MSA):
	- legal contract and agreement of terms
	- a broad framework to cover later transactions
	- many detailed negotiations happen here
	- future projects will be based on this
- Work Order(WO) / Statement of Work(SOW):
	- specific list of things to be completed
	- used in conjunction with a MSA
	- details the scope of the job, location, deliverables, schedule, acceptance criteria and more.
	- was the job done properly lets refer to the SOW.
- Non-disclosure Agreement(NDA):
	- confidentiality agreement between the parties - info in the agreement should not be disclosed
	- protect the confidential info- trade secrets, business activities, anything else listed in the NDA
	- it can be unilateral of Bilateral or multilateral - one way NDA or two way NDA
	- Formal Contract signatures are usually required
- Business Partners Agreement(BPA):
	- going in to business together
	- owner stake
	- financial contract
	- decision making- who makes business decisions, a BPA lists specific individuals and scope
	- prepare for contingencies - financial issues, disaster recovery


### **5.4 Elements of effective security compliance**
- **Compliance:**
	- meeting the standards, laws, policies, and regulations
	- penalties, fines, loss of employment
- compliance reporting: 
	- internal:
		- monitor and report on org compliance efforts
		- large orgs have CCO's
	- External: 
		- documentation
		- annual aro ongoing reporting
		- missing or invalid reports leads to fines, 
		- regulatory complaince
		- SOX,  HIPAA, GLBA
- Consequences 
	- fines
	- sanctions
	- reputational damage
	- loss of license
	- contractual impacts
- compliance monitoring
	- ensure compliance in day to day operations
	- due diligence/ care
		- investigate and verify
	- attestation and knowledge - signoff
	- internal  and external
		- monitor the complaince with the tools
		- provides access of the information to 3rd party
		- may require ongoing monotoring 3rd party ops
	- Automations
- privacy
	- legal implications:
		- local/ regional : state and local govs set privaly limits
		- national: privacy laws for everyone in  the country HIPAA
		- Global: many countries are working together for privacy
		- GDPR: european union reg.
	- data Subject
	- data relationships
	- data roles
	- data inventory and retention
		- all listing of all the data managed
		- and different projects using this data
		- internal use
		- type of data 

### **5.5 Types and purposes of audits and assessments.**
- audits and assessments
	- cybersecurity audits
	- attestation
- internal aiudits
	- compliance
	- audit committee
	- self assessmsnts
- external assessments
	- Regulatory requirements: independent 3rd party
	- Examinations: view records, files
	- Assessment
	- Independent third-party audit
- penetration testing:
	- physical: OS security can be circumvented in physical, doors, windows
	- offensive- red team- attack systems,
	- defensive blue team identify the attacks, prevent unauth access
	- integrated: purple team,
	- working knowledge
	- known envi
	- partially known
	- unknown
	- recon gather info about the target, id key systems min attack area, create a map
		- passive recon: social media, corporate website, online fourms, social engineering, dumpster diving
		- Active recon: trying doors, visible in the neteorks, ping scan, port scan , DNS query, OS fingerprinting 
- Regulatory compliance typically requires risk assessment on a regular basis, often once a year. Ad hoc, one‐time, and continuous risk assessments are used for other purposes to serve the organization but are not as common for regulatory compliance.

### **5.6 Security Awareness Practices.**
- Phishing:
	- Phishing campaigns:
	- to spread awareness across the employees
	- an automated process, centralized reporting, training for incorrect clicks like in-person training
	- recognize a phishing attempt
		- gramatical or spelling mistakes
		- domain and email inconsistencies
		- request for personal information
		- unusual attachements
		- 
	- respond to reported mails
		-  check if the email filtering is working or not
		- orgs should have a process to deal with a phishing email
- anomalous behavior recognition: 
	- risky behavior, - modify host files, replacing core OS files, uploading sensitive files, by a person or service
	- logging from another country, increase data transfer
	- unintentional behaviour wrong domain, usb 
- reporting and monitoring:
	- track and analyze security awareness metrics
	- initial 
	- recurring
- Development
	- of training activities, customized training based on the req compliance requirements
	- create a security awareness team,
	- establish min awareness level
	- integrate compliance mandates - PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR
	- define metrics access performance
- execution
	- create training materials
	- document success
	- identify the stakeholders
	- deploy training materials
	- track he training efforts

#### User Training:
- security awareness training
- policy hand books, online accessible to everyone
- situational awareness
- physical attacks( usb)
- insider threat: 
- password management
- removable media and cables
- social engineering: extensive training, reporting
- ops security - needs to understand data types and provide additional security
- hybrid n/w security, VPN
